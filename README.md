## A roguelike 2D game I made for my brother with C# and Unity
- randomized maps using procedural generation
- made a few sprites using blender and got the rest from the Unity Asset Store and other platforms

## Where can I play the game?
- download the [obscure.exe](/obscure.exe) executable file to play the game natively
